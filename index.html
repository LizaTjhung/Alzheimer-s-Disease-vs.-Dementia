                    Alzheimer's medicines  <b class="viw-text-color">can help with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes</b>. Two types of medicines used to treat symptoms include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b class="viw-text-color">Cholinesterase inhibitors. </b>
                        These medicines work by boosting levels of cell-to-cell communication. The medicines preserve a chemical messenger that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/> These are usually the first medicines tried, and most people see modest improvements in symptoms.</li>

                     <li> <b class="viw-text-color">Memantine (Namenda).</b> This medicine works in another brain cell communication network and slows the progression of symptoms with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. It's sometimes used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Relatively rare side effects include dizziness and confusion.    </li>
                </ol>     
            <li>
                <ol><p>Other medicines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, also called FDA, <b class="viw-text-color">to slow declines in thinking and functioning caused by Alzheimer's disease</b>. The medicines prevent amyloid plaques in the brain from clumping. They're prescribed for people with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.

                    These medicines include:</p>
                    
                            <li>
                                <b class="viw-text-color">Lecanemab-irmb (Leqembi).</b> This medicine is given as an IV infusion every two weeks. Side effects may include infusion-related reactions such as fever, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, changes in heart rate and trouble breathing.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b class="viw-text-color">Donanemab-azbt (Kisunla).</b> This medicine is given as an IV infusion every four weeks. Side effects may include flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, headache, trouble breathing and changes in blood pressure.

                brain cells</b>. This damage interferes with the ability of brain cells
            to communicate with each other. When brain cells cannot communicate
            normally, thinking, behavior and feelings can be affected.
